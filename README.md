# ML Technique Implementation
This implementation was build in python. It uses MNIST datasets and other custom datasets for training and testing. 

the nn.py file is the implementation of a neural network

the runClassifier.py file implements __. 

util.py and utils.py is the implementation of utility functions primarily for math. 

I used anaconda cli to run these files.
